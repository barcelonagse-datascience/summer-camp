# Summer Schedule

Welcome to the MSc. Data Science program 2020! 

The first term of your masters program will be very intense, you will learn a lot in a short amount of time. In order to make sure you take full advantage of that term, it's imperative that you arrive with a basic level of comfort in programming and computing. 

Towards that end, you will complete the following assignments during the summer before the program begins:

2. **Jul 22 - Sep 14** Complete the [Github Classroom Exercises](./classroom). ~40 hours.
3. **Sep 1 - Sep 14** Complete DataCamp assignments. ~15 hours.
