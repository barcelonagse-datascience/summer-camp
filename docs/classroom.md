# Learning Python

## Using this course

The primary purpose for this course is to be able to complete the following 7 assignments:

1. [Functions](https://classroom.github.com/a/e5-TCfcQ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
2. [Conditionals](https://classroom.github.com/a/XdsTjySk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
3. [Loops](https://classroom.github.com/a/yB3E6Bit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
4. [Dictionaries](https://classroom.github.com/a/vK6gNGgh){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
5. [Classes](https://classroom.github.com/a/9QNmpUP8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
6. [JSON](https://classroom.github.com/a/e51aY4mT){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
7. [Test](https://classroom.github.com/a/SM_MZg8Q){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

To help you complete the assignments, you will find a set of recorded lectures below that introduce you to the concepts needed. Along with the videos, you will find a link to the slides in HTML format. You can also find a PDF version of the slides [in this Github respository](https://github.com/barcelonagse-datascience/learning-python){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## Optional Pre-course Materials

#### Udacity

If you have very little programming experience, it can be helpful to walk through the basics with an online, interactive interface. There are many of these online, but the following is free and reasonable:

* [Udacity Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

You should only need to complete lessons 1-2 to be ready to continue with our assignments.
