# Hello World Mini-Assignment

This assignment will prepare your computing environment and introduce you to the tools we will use in all the pre-brushups material. Steps: 

1. Create a Github user account. You just need the basic, free account available to anybody. Choose a username that you can use professionally for the rest of your life (i.e. something not embarrassing).

2. Complete the following assignment: [Hello World Mini-Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/OhVoobZJ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It will walk you through all the steps needed to setup a Unix computing environment with Python and Git and give you practice completing an assignment on Github Classroom, the platform we will use for the rest of this pre-course material. 

### Next Steps

Once you've completed the above assignment, you can move on to the [Github Classroom Exercises](./classroom).
